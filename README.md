# Welcome! :coffee:

Welcome to my repository! This repo contains my solutions to all the exercises from the 2024 Python Programming MOOC by the University of Helsinki.

## Purpose

I created this repository to share my answers with others who are taking the course. If you're struggling with any of the exercises or you just want to compare solutions, feel free to browse through the code. Remember, the best way to learn is by doing, so I encourage you to try solving the exercises on your own first before looking at my solutions.
